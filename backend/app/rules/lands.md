# Lands Rules

## Objective
Be the first player to meet one of the following win conditions:
-   Have 5 energy cards of the same type on your board.
-   Have 1 of each of the 5 different types of energy cards on your board.

You also win if your opponent resigns.

## The Deck
Each player has their own deck of 25 cards, consisting of 5 cards for each of the 5 energy types:
-   Grass
-   Lightning
-   Fire
-   Darkness
-   Water

## Setup
-   The game is for 2 players.
-   Each player shuffles their deck.
-   Each player draws 5 cards to form their starting hand.

## Gameplay
The game is played in turns. The starting player is chosen randomly.

### On Your Turn
1.  **Draw Phase**: At the beginning of your turn (except for the very first turn of the game), you draw one card from your deck.
2.  **Main Phase**: You must play one energy card from your hand. This card is placed in a pending area.

### Counter Phase
After you play a card, your opponent has the opportunity to counter it.

-   **To play a counter**, the opponent must discard one **Water** card and one card that **matches the type** of the card you played.
    -   *Special Case*: To counter a **Water** card, the opponent must discard two **Water** cards.
-   If your card is countered, you have the opportunity to **counter their counter**. To do this, you must discard two **Water** cards.

### Resolution Phase
-   **If your card was not countered** (or if you countered their counter), your card is successfully played. It is moved to your **board**, and you check for a win condition. If you haven't won, the card's special effect is resolved.
-   **If your opponent's counter was successful**, your card is moved to your discard pile and you do not get its effect.

After the resolution phase, your turn ends, and it becomes your opponent's turn.

## Card Effects
When an energy card is successfully played, its effect is triggered:

-   **Grass**: Choose a card from your discard pile and add it to your hand.
-   **Lightning**: Draw a card from your deck.
-   **Fire**: Choose an energy card on your opponent's board and move it to their discard pile.
-   **Darkness**: Your opponent reveals 3 cards from their hand. You choose one of them to be moved to their discard pile.
-   **Water**: Look at the top card of your deck. You may choose to either put it back on top or move it to the bottom of your deck.

## Other Rules
-   **Running out of Cards**: If your deck is empty when you need to draw a card, your discard pile is shuffled to create a new deck.
-   **Winning the Game**: The game ends as soon as a player meets a win condition.
-   **Resigning**: A player can choose to resign at any point on their turn, which results in a loss.
