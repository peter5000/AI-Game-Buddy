# Chess Rules

## Objective
The objective of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king. Checkmate happens when the king is in a position to be captured (in "check") and cannot escape from capture.

## The Board and Pieces
The game is played on a board with 8x8 squares. Each player starts with 16 pieces:
- 1 King
- 1 Queen
- 2 Rooks
- 2 Knights
- 2 Bishops
- 8 Pawns

## How the Pieces Move
- **King**: The king can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- **Queen**: The queen can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal.
- **Rook**: The rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file.
- **Bishop**: The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally.
- **Knight**: The knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. The knight's move can be thought of as an "L" shape - two squares in one direction, and then one square perpendicular to that.
- **Pawn**: Pawns move forward one square, but capture diagonally. On its first move, a pawn can move forward two squares. Pawns cannot move or capture backwards. When a pawn reaches the other side of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece (except the king).

## Special Moves
- **Castling**: A special move involving the king and one of the rooks.
- **En Passant**: A special pawn capture that can only occur immediately after a pawn makes a move of two squares from its starting square, and it could have been captured by an enemy pawn had it only moved one square.

## Winning the Game
- **Checkmate**: You win by checkmating your opponent's king.
- **Resignation**: Your opponent may resign if they feel they cannot win.
- **Forfeit**: Your opponent may lose by forfeit if they violate the rules.

## Drawing the Game
- **Stalemate**: If the player to move has no legal moves, but their king is not in check.
- **Agreement**: The players may agree to a draw.
- **Threefold Repetition**: If the same position occurs three times with the same player to move.
- **Fifty-move Rule**: If 50 moves have been played by each player without the movement of any pawn and without any capture.
- **Insufficient Material**: If neither player has enough pieces to force a checkmate.
