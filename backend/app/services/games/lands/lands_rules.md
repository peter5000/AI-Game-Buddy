# Lands Rules
## Setup

* Each player starts a game with a deck consisting of 25 cards (5 Grass, 5 Lightning, 5 Fire, 5 Darkness, and 5 Water energies).
* Each player shuffles their deck and draws 5 cards.
* Decide who goes first (flip a coin, rock-paper-scissors, etc.).

---
## Gameplay

The first player to get either of the following wins the game:
* 1 of each type of energy into play
* OR
* 5 of the same type of energy into play

### General Rules
* **Deck Out:** If you need to draw a card from an empty deck, you must first shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck. Then, draw a card. If both your deck and discard pile are empty, the draw action fails.

## Phases of a Turn

Each turn is broken down into 5 phases that must be followed in order.

### 1. Draw Phase
The active player draws one card. This phase is skipped on the very first turn of the game for the player who goes first.

### 2. Main Phase
The active player **must** choose and play exactly one energy card from their hand onto the board. The card is considered "pending" and its effect does not resolve yet.

### 3. Counter Phase
After an energy is played in the Main Phase, the non-active player gets an opportunity to counter.
* If the non-active player can and wants to counter, they play the required cards. Priority then shifts back to the active player to counter the counter. This continues until a player cannot or chooses not to respond.
* If no counter is played, the game proceeds to the next phase.

### 4. Resolution Phase
* **If the energy was not countered:** The energy's effect resolves now. (i.e., if you played a Lightning energy during the main phase, draw a card now).
* **If the energy was countered:** The energy is sent to the discard pile without its effect resolving. The phase continues, but there is no pending card effect to resolve.

### 5. End Phase
This is the final step. The game checks to see if the active player has met a win condition. If not, the turn officially ends, and play passes to the next player.

## Energy

### Grass Energy (Green) ðŸŸ¢
* When you play this card, return one energy from your discard pile into your hand.
* **Note:** If your discard pile is empty, this effect does nothing.

### Lightning Energy (Yellow) âš¡
* When you play this card, draw the top card of your deck.
* **Note:** See "Deck Out" under General Rules if your deck is empty.

### Fire Energy (Red) ðŸ”¥
* When you play this card, choose one of your opponent's energies in play. Your opponent discards that energy.
* **Note:** If your opponent has no energies in play, this effect does nothing.

### Darkness Energy (Black) âš«
* When you play this card, your opponent chooses and reveals 3 cards from their hand. You then choose one energy you find there and discard it.
* **Note:** If your opponent has fewer than 3 cards, they must reveal all cards in their hand.

### Water Energy (Blue) ðŸ’§
Water Energy has two effects:
1.  If this card was played during your Main Phase and resolves successfully, look at the top card of your deck. You may either keep it on top or move it to the bottom of the deck.
2.  As a reaction, when your opponent plays an energy, you may discard **this energy** and **an energy of the same type** as the one your opponent played from your hand. Your opponent's energy is discarded without resolving its effect.

## FAQ

**Q: If my opponent uses a Water Energy from their hand to stop me from playing an energy, can I counter their counter?**
**A:** Yes. The cost to counter any energy is `1 Water Energy + 1 Matching Energy`. Since your opponent used a Water Energy, the "matching energy" is also Water. Therefore, you would need to discard **two Water Energies** from your hand (`1 Water + 1 matching Water`) to counter their counter.

**Q: If my opponent plays an energy, do I get to see what their effect targets before I decide to counter?**
**A:** No. Your opponent declares which energy they are playing in the Main Phase. You must be given the opportunity to counter in the Counter Phase *before* the effect takes place in the Resolution Phase.
